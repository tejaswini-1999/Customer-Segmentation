# ðŸ“Š Customer Segmentation & Trend Analysis  
<br>


## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
Customer behavior is constantly evolving, making it crucial for businesses to **segment their audience** effectively and **analyze purchasing trends**. This project applies **machine learning techniques** to segment customers based on spending patterns, demographics, and shopping behavior. By leveraging **clustering and regression models**, the project provides actionable insights to improve marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement.
<br><br>


## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Segment customers based on their purchasing habits, demographics, and shopping behavior.  
- Analyze customer trends to identify spending patterns and optimize marketing campaigns.  
- Develop predictive models for understanding customer preferences and future behavior.  
- Reduce dimensionality using PCA to improve model efficiency and interpretability.  
- Visualize customer clusters** to derive meaningful business insights.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Components  

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Data Cleaning: Removed missing values, handled outliers, and standardized formats.  
- Feature Engineering: Applied encoding, scaling, binning, and feature selection techniques.  
- Dimensionality Reduction: Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for improving clustering accuracy.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualizations
- Demographic Analysis: Visualized spending, income, and age-based shopping habits.  
- Density Distributions: Examined income and spending patterns using probability density functions.  
- Correlation Matrix: Identified relationships between customer attributes.  

### 3. Machine Learning Models for Customer Segmentation
#### Clustering Algorithms:
- K-Means Clustering: Grouped customers based on spending habits and demographics.  
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering): Identified irregular clusters and noise within customer data.  

#### Regression Models for Trend Analysis:
- XGBoost: Used gradient boosting for trend prediction.  
- Random Forest: Applied for predictive modeling of customer spending behavior.  
- Multiple Linear Regression: Evaluated the impact of multiple factors on customer purchasing trends.  

### 4. Comparative Analysis of Models
- Compared regression models for predicting customer spending trends.  
- Evaluated clustering models to determine the best segmentation approach.
